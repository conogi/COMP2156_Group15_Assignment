Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), which is the core of every software development process, is a planned approach to software development, from gathering requirements to the final deployment of the software.
The SDLC process varies according to the needs of the business using models like the Waterfall Model, Agile Model, Iterative Model, Spiral Model, and V-shaped Model, which have their own approach.
DevOps plays a significant role in the Software Development Lifecycle as it enables collaboration among teams and thus ensures quality and speed development. DevOps helps in the rapid development of software, improves reliability, and is easy to manage once you understand what you are doing.
DevOps and SDLC both have the same goal of developing high-quality software in an efficient manner, but DevOps focuses on continuous integration, automation, and collaboration between development and operations, whereas SDLC is a phase-by-phase process that guides the entire software development life cycle.
