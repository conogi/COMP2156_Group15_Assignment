DevOps For System Administration

In this course, we'll learn about the procedures and best practices that a DevOps engineer brings to a workplace environment to increase 
productivity. 

We will also take a look at various operation implementations available and have hands-on work using an industry standard 
toolkit. We will cover several different data formats and types including XML (Extensible Markup Language), JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), 
YAML (Yet Another Markup Language), and YANG (Yet Another Next Generation). 

We will also cover tools including Ansible and Git.
