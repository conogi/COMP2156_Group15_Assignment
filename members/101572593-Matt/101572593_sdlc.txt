DevOps is important in the software development life cycle (SDLC) because it improves how work moves from development to deployment. Without DevOps practices, teams often rely on manual steps and inconsistent environments, which increases risk and slows releases.

DevOps practices like CI pipelines, automation, and repeatable workflows help catch issues earlier and make releases more reliable. This improves collaboration and shortens feedback loops across the SDLC.
