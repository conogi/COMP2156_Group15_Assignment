George Brown Polytechnic was established in 1967. It is named after George Brown, a politician and newspaper publisher 
(he founded what later became The Globe and Mail). George Brown Polytechnic has a few different campuses including Casa Loma Campus, 
St James Campus and the Waterfront Campus. There is also another campus located at Toronto Metropolitan University.

I am currently in the 4th Semester of T187, Computer Systems Technology at George Brown Polytechnic.
